# Javascript Selector

##Context
The aim of this project was to create a JavaScript selection engine that returned DOM elements with a given CSS selector. I started off by experimenting with my code and passed all the tests. This allowed me to have a better understanding of how to extract elements from the DOM without using jQuery. Once all my tests were passing, I decided to restart the project. I decided to split the passed in selector by id, class or tag name. Then iterate through the split selectors and eliminate any DOM elements from an array if they didn't contain that id, class or tag name. 

##Technology
